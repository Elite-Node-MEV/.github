### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Us
<a name="about-us"></a>

Elite Node is a private collective of low-latency engineers and quantitative developers specializing in high-frequency infrastructure for Solana MEV. We do not build public-facing products; we forge surgical instruments for professional market participants who demand absolute performance.

Our work is conducted under strict Non-Disclosure Agreements, and access to our repositories is restricted to core team members and strategic partners.

> For a detailed overview of our project, philosophy, and infrastructure, please refer to our official **[GitBook documentation](https://elite-node.gitbook.io/elite-node-docs)**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology
<a name="technology"></a>

Our stack is a vertically-integrated solution designed to minimize latency at every stage of the transaction lifecycle.

*   **Infrastructure:** Proprietary, co-located **Firedancer** nodes in key geographical locations (primarily Frankfurt).
*   **Data Ingestion:** Direct, low-level integration with **Jito Shredstream** for pre-finalization state access.
*   **Execution Core:** A fully asynchronous, high-performance engine written in **Rust** on the `tokio` runtime.
*   **Execution Venues:** Multiplexed transaction submission via the **Jito Block Engine** and other SWQoS providers.

### üìà Status
<a name="status"></a>

Our core infrastructure is operational and undergoing continuous performance tuning. We are actively developing and backtesting proprietary alpha strategies in a simulated environment.

Access to our systems is currently in a closed-beta phase with a select group of partners.

### üìû Contact & Collaboration
<a name="contact"></a>

Elite Node operates on a private, partnership-based model. We are not a public-access service.
